The datasets are stored as follows:

&nbsp;1. In datasets, there lives a test and train folder.\
&nbsp;2. Each of these folders contains, respectively, images the model is trained on and images used for testing the performance.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. Within the train folder there is:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.1. a folder original, with the images copied from the BreaKHis dataset \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.2. a folder pgd_attack, with two nested folders:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. a folder swin, which contains all perturbed images from the original generated by attacking the swin model, used for retraining the swin model. \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. a folder resnet, which contains all perturbed images from the original generated by attacking the resnet model, used for retraining the resnet model \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3.. Within the test folder there is: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3.1. a folder original, with the images copied from the BreaKHis dataset \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3.2. the folders one_pixel_attack, pgd_attack and triangle_attack, which all contain: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. a folder swin with all test images perturbed by attacking the swin network \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. a folder resnet with all test images perturbed by attacking the resnet network
